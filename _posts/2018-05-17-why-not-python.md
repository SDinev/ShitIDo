Of all things, I started looking into some Python basics. Doesn't help any of my tasks, but it sure is interesting to see some weird syntaxes being thrown my way :)

I was able to quickly go through the basics in video format in TreeHouse's Python Basics course https://teamtreehouse.com/library/python-basics-3
Namely - variables, data types, how to write if statements. Gotta love the "elif" and the "len" @_@. The guys who came up with the language were seriously making some savings!
